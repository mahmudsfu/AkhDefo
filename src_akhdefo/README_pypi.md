## Computer Vision for Slope Stability: Land Deformation Monitoring

## Background of Akh-Defo

**Akh-Defo** is derived from two distinct words: 
1. 'Akh' in the Kurdish language, representing land, earth, or soil (originating from the Kurdish Badini dialect).
2. 'Defo', a shorthand for the English term 'deformation'.

## Updates

- **Deprecated:** Akhdefo version one. *Current recommendation:* Use Akhdefo version 2.
- **New Feature:** Cloud-based real-time processing capabilities.
- **Expansion:** Over 20 modules for end-to-end Python-based GIS and Image Processing, and Customized Figure generation.
- **Integration:** Access, filter, and download capabilities for Planet Labs data using the Planet Lab API.
- **Enhancement:** Orthorectification feature for satellite images.


# Installation of AkhDefo Software Method 1 on Linux Operating System

**Method 1 works well on Linux Operating System** **Use method 2 to install on Windows Operating System**

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a Conda environment using the provided [akhdefo_conda_env.yml](akhdefo_conda_env.yml) file. This file specifies all the necessary packages, including their versions, required for the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Conda**: Make sure you have either Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system. If you do not have Conda installed, you can download it from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

## Creating the Environment

1. **Download the YAML File**: Ensure you have the `akhdefo_conda_env.yml` [Click Here to Download](akhdefo_conda_env.yml) file saved on your computer. This file should be in the directory where you intend to set up the environment, or you should note its path.

2. **Open a Terminal**: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) and navigate to the directory containing the [akhdefo_conda_env.yml](akhdefo_conda_env.yml) file. You can navigate to the directory using the `cd` command followed by the path to the directory.

3. **Create the Environment**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

***Make sure to activate conda base environment***


```bash
conda activate base # if base environment not activated

conda install -c conda-forge mamba

mamba env create -f akhdefo_conda_env.yml

```

This command instructs Conda to create a new environment with the name specified in the YAML file (`akhdefo_env`) and install all the listed packages along with their dependencies.

4. **Activate the Environment**: After the environment has been successfully created, you can activate it using the following command:

```bash
conda activate akhdefo_env
```

Activating the environment will set up your terminal session to use the packages and their specific versions installed in this environment.

## Verifying the Installation

To ensure that the environment has been set up correctly and all packages are installed, you can list the installed packages using:

```bash
conda list
```

This command displays a list of all packages installed in the active conda environment.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, make sure you have the latest version of Conda installed, and try updating Conda using the following command:

```bash
conda update conda
```

If problems persist, refer to the [official Conda documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) for more detailed information on managing environments with YAML files.

## Conclusion

You now have a dedicated Conda environment for this project, containing all the necessary packages. This environment helps maintain project dependencies isolated from other projects, ensuring reproducibility and consistency.

# Installation of AkhDefo Software Method 2 on Windows Operating System


This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a Conda environment using the provided [ENV_Win.yml](ENV_Win.yml) file. This file specifies all the necessary packages, including their versions, required for the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Conda**: Make sure you have either Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system. If you do not have Conda installed, you can download it from the [official Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or the [Miniconda website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. **Open a Terminal**: Open your terminal (or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows) and navigate to the directory containing the [ENV_Win.yml](ENV_Win.yml) file. You can navigate to the directory using the `cd` command followed by the path to the directory.

3. **Create the Environment**: Execute the following command in your terminal:

***Make sure to activate conda base environment***


```bash
conda activate base # if base environment not activated

conda env create -f ENV_Win.yml

```

This command instructs Conda to create a new environment with the name specified in the YAML file (`akhdefo_env`) and install all the listed packages along with their dependencies.

4. **Activate the Environment**: After the environment has been successfully created, you can activate it using the following command:

```bash
