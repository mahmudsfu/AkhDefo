# Stawamus Chief Rockfall Monitoring Example

## Example September 20th, 2021 RockFall Event

### Introduction
This document presents a demonstration project utilizing the *Akhdefo* software for real-time monitoring of rockfalls. The project focuses on the application of optical flow processing using live camera feeds.

### Real-Time Monitoring and Analysis
The core of this project lies in its capability to analyze and visualize displacement-time curves before and during rockfall events. Such data is invaluable in training neural network models aimed at enhancing early warning systems for landslides and rockfall hazards.

### Live Feed Integration
The following embedded frame provides direct access to our live monitoring interface:
