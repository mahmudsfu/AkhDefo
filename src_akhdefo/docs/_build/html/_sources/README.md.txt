## Computer Vision for Slope Stability: Land Deformation Monitoring



## Background of Akh-Defo

**Akh-Defo** is derived from two distinct words: 
1. 'Akh' in the Kurdish language, representing land, earth, or soil (originating from the Kurdish Badini dialect).
2. 'Defo', a shorthand for the English term 'deformation'.
